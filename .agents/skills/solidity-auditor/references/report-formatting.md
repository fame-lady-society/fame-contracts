# Report Formatting

## Report Path

Save the report to `{project-name}-pashov-ai-audit-report-{timestamp}.md` in the current working directory, where `{project-name}` is the repo root basename and `{timestamp}` is `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` at scan time.

## Output Format

## Leads

_Vulnerability trails with concrete code smells where the full exploit path could not be completed in one analysis pass. These are not false positives — they are high-signal leads for manual review. Not scored._

- **<Title>** — `Contract.function` — Code smells: <missing guard, unsafe arithmetic, etc.> — <1-2 sentence description of the trail and what remains unverified>
- **<Title>** — `Contract.function` — Code smells: <...> — <1-2 sentence description>

**Rules:** Follow the template above exactly. Sort findings by confidence (highest first). Findings below the threshold get a description but no **Fix** block. Draft findings directly in report format — do not re-generate.
